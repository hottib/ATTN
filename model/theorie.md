# Reinforcement learning i.e. Deep Q learning

## Who is who:
### Cumulative reward
- The cumulative reward or return $$ R_{t_0}=\sum^{\inf}_{t=t_0} \gamma^{t-t_0}r_t $$
where $\gamma$ is the a constant in ${0,1}$ determining magnitude of cintribution of near future (close to $1$) and far future (close to 0)
